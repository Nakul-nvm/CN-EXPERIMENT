# 🌐 Computer Networks Lab – 4th Semester, 2nd Year

This repository contains lab experiments completed as part of the Computer Networks course in the 4th semester of B.Tech in Computer Science. 
The experiments cover a range of networking concepts including error detection techniques, routing algorithms, flow control, and basic client-server communication.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Error detection and framing techniques
- CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
- Routing algorithms (e.g., shortest path, spanning tree)
- Distance vector and link state routing
- Flow and congestion control using window-based mechanisms
- Basic socket programming and client-server architecture
